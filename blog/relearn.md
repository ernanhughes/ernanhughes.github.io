## Summary

The paper [**"ReLearn: Unlearning via Learning for Large Language Models"**](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2502.11190) presents a novel method for *unlearning* in LLMs while preserving fluency and relevance. 
It introduces a data augmentation and fine-tuning pipeline as an alternative to 'gradient ascent (GA)' and 'negative preference optimization (NPO]', which degrade linguistic coherence.


## **How to Implement This Paper**
To implement **ReLearn**, we will follow these key steps:

### **1. Understanding the Core Approach**
- **Data Augmentation**: Generate diverse question-answer (QA) variations for forgetting while ensuring non-sensitive yet relevant responses.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Replace the knowledge to be forgotten with relevant but non-sensitive responses.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Use the paper's Knowledge Forgetting Rate (KFR), Knowledge Retention Rate (KRR), and Linguistic Score (LS) for performance assessment.

### **2. Setting Up the Development Environment**
We need:
- **A large language model (LLM)**: Llama-2-7b-chat or Gemma-2-2b-it (from the paper).
- **Training framework**: PyTorch with Hugging Faceâ€™s `transformers` and `datasets`.
- **Fine-tuning tools**: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.
- **Evaluation libraries**: `sentence-transformers`, `nltk`, and GPT-4 API for linguistic evaluation.

### **3. Implementing the Unlearning Pipeline**
We can break this into:

#### **Step 1: Data Augmentation**
- Augment QA pairs using LLM-based synthetic transformations:
  - **Simple Variant**: Rephrase the question.
  - **Contextual Variant**: Add context to generalize.
  - **Noise Variant**: Introduce noise to make the model robust.
  - **Logical Variant**: Change the logic of the question.
- Augment answers by replacing specific information with generic responses.

#### **Step 2: Content Verification**
- Check for sensitive information in generated responses using GPT-based classifiers.

#### **Step 3: Data Diversification**
- Convert QA into sentence completion tasks.
- Integrate generic knowledge from Wikipedia and chatbot datasets.

#### **Step 4: Fine-Tuning**
- Use **cross-entropy loss** on augmented forget and retain datasets.
- Employ **KL divergence loss** to minimize the difference from the pre-unlearning model.

#### **Step 5: Evaluation**
- Implement the **KFR, KRR, and LS** metrics.
- Use **GPT-4** or another LLM for fluency and relevance evaluation.

## **Step 1: Setting Up the Environment**
Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn transformers torch accelerate peft bitsandbytes sentence-transformers datasets
```

---

## **Step 2: Model Fine-Tuning (Unlearning)**
We'll use **LoRA fine-tuning** to apply the ReLearn unlearning approach.

### **Load the Base Model**
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch

MODEL_NAME = "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf"  # Change to Gemma if needed

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME, load_in_8bit=True, device_map="auto")
```

---

### **Prepare Unlearning Data**
Create augmented question-answer pairs.

```python
unlearning_data = [
    {"question": "What is John Doe's email?", "answer": "John Doe's contact details are private."},
    {"question": "Where does Alice live?", "answer": "Alice's location is not publicly available."}
]
```

---

### **Fine-Tune with LoRA**
```python
from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model
from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer

lora_config = LoraConfig(
    r=8, lora_alpha=32, target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"], lora_dropout=0.1, bias="none"
)
model = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)

# Tokenize data
def tokenize_data(data):
    return tokenizer(data["question"], data["answer"], padding="max_length", truncation=True)

train_dataset = [{"input_ids": tokenize_data(q)["input_ids"], "labels": tokenize_data(q)["input_ids"]} for q in unlearning_data]

# Training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    per_device_train_batch_size=2,
    learning_rate=5e-5,
    num_train_epochs=1,
    output_dir="./relearn-model",
    save_strategy="epoch"
)

trainer = Trainer(model=model, args=training_args, train_dataset=train_dataset)
trainer.train()
```

---

## **Step 3: API for Unlearning Queries**
Create a **FastAPI** service.

### **API Server**
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class QueryRequest(BaseModel):
    question: str

@app.post("/unlearn/")
async def unlearn_query(request: QueryRequest):
    input_text = request.question
    input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
    output_ids = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=50)
    response = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return {"response": response}
```

Run the API:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
---

## **Step 4: Frontend with Streamlit (Optional)**
Install Streamlit:
```bash
pip install streamlit
```

Create `app.py`:
```python
import streamlit as st
import requests

st.title("ReLearn: AI Unlearning App")
question = st.text_input("Ask a question:")

if st.button("Submit"):
    response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/unlearn/", json={"question": question}).json()
    st.write(response["response"])
```

Run:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Notes

### **Gradient Ascent (GA) in the Context of Language Models:**

* **Core Idea:**
    * In the context of aligning language models, GA is often used to directly maximize a reward signal. This reward signal might be a score from a preference model or some other metric that indicates how well the generated text aligns with desired characteristics (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness).
    * Essentially, the model's parameters are adjusted in the direction that increases the reward.
* **How it Degrades Coherence:**
    * **Over-optimization:**
        * GA can lead to over-optimization, where the model becomes overly focused on maximizing the reward at the expense of other important qualities, such as fluency and naturalness.
        * The model might start generating text that is highly optimized for the reward but sounds unnatural or nonsensical.
    * **Reward hacking:**
        * The model may learn to find ways to "hack" the reward function, generating text that scores high but doesn't genuinely reflect the desired characteristics.
        * For example, if the reward is based on the presence of certain keywords, the model might overuse those keywords, resulting in repetitive and unnatural text.
    * **Loss of diversity:**
        * GA can cause the model to converge to a narrow set of highly rewarded outputs, reducing the diversity of generated text.

## **Negative Preference Optimization (NPO):**

* **Core Idea:**
    * NPO aims to discourage the model from generating text that is associated with negative preferences.
    * Instead of directly maximizing a positive reward, it focuses on minimizing a "negative reward" or loss associated with undesirable outputs.
    * This is often done by comparing the output of the model against a set of negative examples.
* **How it Degrades Coherence:**
    * **Over-correction:**
        * NPO can lead to over-correction, where the model becomes overly cautious and avoids generating certain types of text, even if they are linguistically valid.
        * This can result in bland, generic, or overly constrained text.
    * **"Gaping holes" in the output distribution:**
        * By focusing on avoiding negative preferences, NPO might create "gaps" in the model's output distribution, where certain types of coherent and natural text are suppressed.
    * **Conflicting negatives:**
        * If the negative preferences are not well-defined or are contradictory, the model might struggle to find a balance, leading to incoherent or inconsistent outputs.
    * **Loss of natural flow:**
        * Constantly avoiding negative examples can cause the model to produce text that lacks a natural flow or rhythm.

**General Factors Contributing to Coherence Degradation:**

* **Reward/Loss Function Design:** The design of the reward or loss function is crucial. If it doesn't accurately capture the desired characteristics, the model might learn to optimize for the wrong things.
* **Data Bias:** If the training data is biased, the model might learn to generate text that reflects those biases, leading to incoherent or inappropriate outputs.
* **Optimization Techniques:** The specific optimization techniques used can also affect coherence. Aggressive optimization or insufficient regularization can lead to overfitting and degraded fluency.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Careful Reward/Loss Function Design:** Use reward/loss functions that accurately capture the desired characteristics and promote linguistic coherence.
* **Regularization Techniques:** Use regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and encourage diversity.
* **Hybrid Approaches:** Combine GA and NPO with other techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), to balance alignment and coherence.
* **Human Evaluation:** Regularly evaluate the model's output using human evaluators to identify and address coherence issues.
* **Constrained Decoding:** Use decoding strategies that allow for the enforcement of rules to maintain coherence.
* **Iterative Refinement:** Use an iterative refinement approach, where the model's output is gradually improved through multiple rounds of optimization and feedback.
