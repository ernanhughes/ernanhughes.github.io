## **Introduction**
Financial markets are complex and highly volatile, demanding robust and adaptive trading strategies. Traditional methods, such as statistical modeling and machine learning, often fall short in handling dynamic market conditions. To address these limitations, researchers have proposed a `Mixture of Experts` (MoE) approach, which distributes decision-making across multiple specialized models.

This paper [LLM-Based Routing in Mixture of Experts: A Novel Framework for Trading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09636) introduces **LLMoE**â€”a novel framework that integrates `Large Language Models` (LLMs) as routers within an `MoE` architecture. We are going to implement that isn this blog post.

## **Understanding Mixture of Experts (MoE)**
MoE is a machine learning technique that partitions complex decision tasks among multiple expert models. A router assigns data instances to the most relevant expert, improving both efficiency and accuracy. While MoE has seen success in deep learning and NLP, its adoption in financial markets has been limited due to static routing mechanisms.

### **Limitations of Traditional MoE in Trading**
- **Static Routing**: Conventional MoE uses fixed neural networks as routers, which struggle with shifting market dynamics.
- **Unimodal Data Processing**: Most MoE-based trading models rely only on numerical stock data, ignoring valuable textual insights from news articles.
- **Lack of Interpretability**: Neural network-based routers operate as black boxes, making it difficult to understand their decision-making.

### **How LLMoE Overcomes These Challenges**
LLMoE leverages **pre-trained LLMs** as dynamic routers, allowing them to:
1. **Integrate Multimodal Data**: It processes both historical stock prices and textual news data.
2. **Provide Context-Aware Expert Selection**: The LLM router dynamically classifies market sentiment as *Optimistic* or *Pessimistic* and assigns expert models accordingly.
3. **Improve Interpretability**: LLM-generated natural language explanations enhance transparency in decision-making.

---

## **LLMoE Framework: Key Components**
LLMoE consists of three key stages:

### **1. LLM-Based Router**
The LLM router processes a rolling window of stock market data combined with news headlines. Given an input sequence:

\[
X(t-4:t) = \{ x_{t-4}, x_{t-3}, x_{t-2}, x_{t-1}, x_t \}
\]

where each \( x_i \) is a combination of numerical stock features and corresponding news text, the router predicts **Optimistic** or **Pessimistic** market sentiment:

\[
y_t = \arg\max (LLM\_Prediction(X(t-4:t)))
\]

Additionally, it generates **natural language explanations** for its classification, improving interpretability.

### **2. Expert Prediction**
Based on the routerâ€™s classification, data is sent to either an *Optimistic Expert* or *Pessimistic Expert*. Each expert is a **feedforward neural network (FNN)** trained to analyze stock trends under specific market conditions. Experts process numerical stock indicators such as:
- **Price Ratios**: Open, High, Low, Close
- **Daily Price Changes**: Percentage changes in closing prices
- **Rolling Deviations**: Moving averages over different time periods

### **3. Trading Strategy Generation**
LLMoE employs an **"All-in All-out"** strategy:
- **Invest all capital** if the expert predicts a price increase.
- **Liquidate holdings** if the expert predicts a price decline.

This strategy ensures capital is dynamically adjusted to maximize returns.

## **Python Implementation of LLMoE**
Letâ€™s break down a Python implementation using **PyTorch** and **Hugging Face Transformers**.

### **Step 1: LLM-Based Router Implementation**
We use `Llama3.2` (or an equivalent LLM) to classify market sentiment based on numerical and textual data.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer
import torch

class LLMRouter:
    def __init__(self, model_name="meta-llama/Llama-3-8B"):
        self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
        self.model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)
        self.model.eval()

    def classify_sentiment(self, text):
        inputs = self.tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, padding=True)
        with torch.no_grad():
            outputs = self.model(**inputs)
        sentiment = torch.argmax(outputs.logits).item()
        return "Optimistic" if sentiment == 1 else "Pessimistic"

# Example usage
router = LLMRouter()
print(router.classify_sentiment("Stock prices are rising despite market uncertainty."))
```

---

### **Step 2: Expert Models for Market Prediction**
We train separate **Optimistic** and **Pessimistic** experts using PyTorch.

```python
import torch.nn as nn

class ExpertModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size=55):
        super(ExpertModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 64)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, 32)
        self.fc4 = nn.Linear(32, 1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.dropout(self.relu(self.fc2(x)))
        x = self.dropout(self.relu(self.fc3(x)))
        return torch.sigmoid(self.fc4(x))

optimistic_expert = ExpertModel()
pessimistic_expert = ExpertModel()
```

---

### **Step 3: Decision-Making for Trading**
We use the expert models to generate trading signals.

```python
def generate_trade_signal(router_output, stock_features):
    if router_output == "Optimistic":
        prediction = optimistic_expert(stock_features)
    else:
        prediction = pessimistic_expert(stock_features)
    
    return "BUY" if prediction.item() > 0.5 else "SELL"

# Example usage
sample_stock_data = torch.rand(1, 55)  # Simulated stock features
decision = generate_trade_signal("Optimistic", sample_stock_data)
print(f"Trading Decision: {decision}")
```
