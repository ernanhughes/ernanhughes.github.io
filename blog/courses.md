## Some FREE AI courses on Agents I recommend doing

Agents were important in Machine Learning development last year. 

These are some courses I have done and recommend they are all free.  
A good reason to do courses and look at youtube videos is you will learn current applications of AI and may get ideas for new applications.


## AI Agentic Design Patterns with AutoGen 
[AI Agentic Design Patterns with AutoGen](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/ai-agentic-design-patterns-with-autogen/)  

**Topics**: Agents, Microsoft, Autogen. 

This is a good short course will give you an idea of what agents can do and how the can be built using Autogen. The same approaches outlined here can be used in many of the Agentic frameworks I recommend it even if you are not using Autogen.

## Serverless Agentic Workflows with Amazon Bedrock
[Serverless Agentic Workflows with Amazon Bedrock](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/serverless-agentic-workflows-with-amazon-bedrock/)


**Topics**: Agents, AWS, AWS Bedrock, Guardrails 

This was a great course. In dept shows you how to build a real agent solution on the AWS Bedrock framework. Recommend this course if you are using this platform or considering it.

## LLMs as Operating Systems: Agent Memory
[LLMs as Operating Systems: Agent Memory](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/llms-as-operating-systems-agent-memory/)


**Topics**: Agents, Agent Memory

An advanced course shows how we can give the agent memory. The course is given by the authors of the paper [MemGPT: Towards LLMs as Operating Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08560).

Memory gives the LLM a life like dynamic and is really useful to a lot of user. I recommend this course as it shows how to implement this while covering the challenges of implementing it correctly.

## Multi AI Agent Systems with crewAI
[Multi AI Agent Systems with crewAI](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/multi-ai-agent-systems-with-crewai)

**Topics** Agents, CrewAI, Multi Agent collaboration 

This is an advanced course given by the CEO of CrewAI. I covers agents CrewAI a platform for agents. It also covers Multi Agent collaboration.
