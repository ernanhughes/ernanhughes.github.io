## **How Text-to-Speech Works**
At a high level, TTS involves converting **text input** into **spoken audio output**. This process consists of three main stages:

### **1. Text Processing (Linguistic Analysis)**
- The input text is broken down into **phonemes** (smallest units of sound).
- Sentence structure and punctuation are analyzed to determine **intonation** and **pauses**.

### **2. Acoustic Modeling**
- This step predicts how each phoneme should sound by considering **pitch, duration, and articulation**.
- Early TTS systems used **concatenative synthesis**, where pre-recorded speech fragments were stitched together.
- Modern deep learning-based TTS relies on **neural networks** to generate highly realistic and expressive speech.

### **3. Waveform Generation**
- This step converts the synthesized phonemes into a human-like voice.
- Deep learning models such as **WaveNet**, **Tacotron**, and **VITS** are widely used for this purpose.

## **Evolution of TTS Technology**
### **Early Rule-Based Systems**
- Based on hand-coded rules and phonetic dictionaries.
- Voices sounded robotic and unnatural.

### **Concatenative Synthesis (Pre-Recorded Speech)**
- Uses recorded speech units.
- Produces **higher quality but limited flexibility**.

### **Statistical Parametric Synthesis (HMM & DNN-Based)**
- Uses machine learning models to generate speech dynamically.
- More flexible than concatenative synthesis but **less natural**.

### **Neural TTS (WaveNet, Tacotron, FastSpeech, VITS)**
- Deep learning models that **mimic human speech patterns**.
- Can generate expressive, emotionally rich speech.

## **Applications of Text-to-Speech**
* **Accessibility** ‚Äì Screen readers (e.g., NVDA, JAWS) help visually impaired users.  
* **Voice Assistants** ‚Äì Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa use TTS for human-like conversations.  
* **Audiobooks & Podcasting** ‚Äì Automatic audiobook generation with expressive voices.  
* **Customer Support** ‚Äì IVR (Interactive Voice Response) systems in call centers.  
* **Language Learning & Translation** ‚Äì Real-time spoken translations.  
* **Developer Tools** ‚Äì AI-driven voice interfaces for applications.  
* **Voice Cloning & AI Avatars** ‚Äì AI-powered synthetic voices for entertainment & digital humans.

## **Implementing TTS in Python**
There are several open-source libraries for building TTS applications in Python:

### **1. Using `pyttsx3` (Offline TTS)**
This is a lightweight offline TTS engine.

```python
import pyttsx3

# Initialize TTS engine
engine = pyttsx3.init()

# Set properties (voice rate, volume, etc.)
engine.setProperty("rate", 150)
engine.setProperty("volume", 1.0)

# Convert text to speech
engine.say("Hello! Welcome to Text-to-Speech in Python.")
engine.runAndWait()
```
‚úÖ Works **offline**  
‚úÖ Supports **different voices**  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Less natural** than deep learning-based TTS  

---

### **2. Using `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech)**
This library provides cloud-based speech synthesis.

```python
from gtts import gTTS
import os

text = "Hello! This is a test of Google Text-to-Speech."
tts = gTTS(text=text, lang="en")

# Save the audio file
tts.save("gtts_output.mp3")

from IPython.display import Audio
display(Audio('gtts_output.mp3', autoplay=True))
```

‚úÖ **High-quality voices**  
‚úÖ Supports **multiple languages**  
‚ö†Ô∏è Requires **internet connection**  

---

### **3. Using pytorch `Tacotron2`**

```python
import torch
from TTS.api import TTS

# Load a pre-trained TTS model
tts = TTS("tts_models/en/ljspeech/tacotron2-DDC", progress_bar=True).to("cuda")

# Convert text to speech
tts.tts_to_file(text="Deep learning-based text-to-speech is amazing!", file_path="output.wav")
```
‚úÖ **Realistic voice**  
‚úÖ **Supports GPU acceleration**  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Requires deep learning models & dependencies**

## **Voice Cloning: Replicating Any Voice with AI**
### **What is Voice Cloning?**
Voice cloning is a specialized TTS application where AI **learns a person's voice from a short audio sample** and then generates speech that sounds like them.

### **How Voice Cloning Works**
1. **Speaker Embedding** ‚Äì The model extracts unique features of the target speaker‚Äôs voice.
2. **Text-to-Speech Synthesis** ‚Äì The extracted voice features are combined with new text to generate realistic speech.
3. **Fine-Tuning (Optional)** ‚Äì Further training on the target speaker‚Äôs dataset improves quality.

### **Popular Voice Cloning Models**
- **Resemble AI**
- **ElevenLabs**
- **Meta‚Äôs Voicebox**
- **VITS (Variational Inference Text-to-Speech)**
- **Real-Time Voice Cloning (RTVC)**

### **Implementing Voice Cloning in Python**
We use the **RTVC (Real-Time Voice Cloning)** model.

#### **Installation**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning.git
cd Real-Time-Voice-Cloning
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### **Clone a Voice**
```python
from synthesizer.inference import Synthesizer
from encoder import inference as encoder
from vocoder import inference as vocoder
import numpy as np
import torch

# Load pre-trained models
encoder.load_model("saved_models/default/encoder.pt")
synthesizer = Synthesizer("saved_models/default/synthesizer.pt")
vocoder.load_model("saved_models/default/vocoder.pt")

# Load and process a voice sample
wav = synthesizer.load_wav("path/to/speaker.wav", 16000)
embedding = encoder.embed_utterance(wav)

# Generate cloned speech
text = "Hello! This is an AI-generated version of my voice."
specs = synthesizer.synthesize_spectrograms([text], [embedding])
generated_wav = vocoder.infer_waveform(specs[0])

# Save the output
import soundfile as sf
sf.write("cloned_voice.wav", generated_wav, 22050)
```

‚úÖ **High-quality cloned voices**  
‚úÖ Works with **a few seconds of audio**  
‚ö†Ô∏è **May require a powerful GPU**

## Example

Convert a pdf to an Audio book


```python

# get text from pdf
import pdfplumber as pp

text = ''
with pp.open(r"your_pdf.pdf") as pdf:
    for page in pdf.pages:
        text += page.extract_text()    

from gtts import gTTS

# Convert Extracted Text to Speech
def create_audiobook(text):
    tts = gTTS(text=text, lang='en')
    tts.save(r"output_audio.mp3")  # Replace with your desired output path

create_audiobook(text)

```
