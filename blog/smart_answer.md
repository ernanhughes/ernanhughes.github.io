## **Summary**

This blog post explores how **TextGrad** [Yuksekgonul et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07496) and **Test-Time Scaling** [Jurayj et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13962) can be combined to create a self-improving AI answering system that:
- Iteratively refines responses using **LLM-generated textual feedback**.
- Dynamically increases compute to improve reasoning when confidence is low.
- Avoids incorrect answers in high-stakes situations by abstaining when uncertain.

By merging these techniques, we achieve **more reliable, context-aware, and confidence-calibrated AI responses**.

It shows how to test this new implementation against a standard approach. 
It also shows how you could incorporate it into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.

## **SmartAnswer Class Implementation**

To encapsulate our approach, we define a `SmartAnswer` class that implements the TextGrad and Test-Time Scaling solution:

```python
import textgrad as tg
import numpy as np

class SmartAnswer:
    def __init__(self, model_name="gpt-4o", confidence_threshold=0.95, max_iterations=3):
        self.model = tg.BlackboxLLM(model_name)
        self.confidence_threshold = confidence_threshold
        self.max_iterations = max_iterations

    def estimate_confidence(self, response):
        """
        Estimates confidence based on token probabilities using entropy-based normalization.
        """
        token_probs = np.array(response.token_probabilities)  # Assuming token_probabilities is available
        entropy = -np.sum(token_probs * np.log(token_probs))
        normalized_confidence = 1 - (entropy / np.log(len(token_probs)))  # Normalize between 0 and 1
        return normalized_confidence

    def generate_answer(self, question_text):
        question = tg.Variable(question_text, requires_grad=False)
        answer = self.model(question)
        answer.confidence = self.estimate_confidence(answer)
        
        # Apply TextGrad optimization
        loss_fn = tg.TextLoss("Evaluate the answer and suggest improvements.")
        for _ in range(self.max_iterations):
            loss = loss_fn(answer)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer = tg.TGD(parameters=[answer])
            optimizer.step()
            answer.confidence = self.estimate_confidence(answer)
        
        # Apply Test-Time Scaling
        if answer.confidence < self.confidence_threshold:
            refined_answer = self.model.compute_more_steps(question)
            refined_answer.confidence = self.estimate_confidence(refined_answer)
            if refined_answer.confidence > answer.confidence:
                answer = refined_answer
        
        # Decide whether to answer or abstain
        if answer.confidence >= self.confidence_threshold:
            return answer.value
        else:
            return "Model chooses to abstain due to low confidence."
```

## **Comparing SmartAnswer vs. Standard LLM Approach**

To evaluate the benefits of `SmartAnswer`, we compare it against a standard LLM response generation approach:

```python
# Standard LLM Approach
class StandardLLM:
    def __init__(self, model_name="gpt-4o"):
        self.model = tg.BlackboxLLM(model_name)
    
    def generate_answer(self, question_text):
        question = tg.Variable(question_text, requires_grad=False)
        return self.model(question).value
```

### **Testing the Two Approaches**

```python
# Initialize models
smart_answer = SmartAnswer()
standard_llm = StandardLLM()

question_text = "What is the capital of France?"

# Generate responses
smart_response = smart_answer.generate_answer(question_text)
standard_response = standard_llm.generate_answer(question_text)

print(f"SmartAnswer Response: {smart_response}")
print(f"Standard LLM Response: {standard_response}")
```

### **Expected Outcome**
- The **SmartAnswer system** will refine the answer iteratively and return a **higher-confidence response**.
- The **Standard LLM** will return an answer instantly, without confidence validation or iterative improvements.
- If SmartAnswer's confidence threshold is not met, it may abstain, improving reliability in high-stakes applications.

## **Incorporating SmartAnswer into a RAG-Based System**

A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** enhances LLM responses by retrieving relevant documents before generating an answer. `SmartAnswer` can be seamlessly integrated into a RAG pipeline to refine responses iteratively while ensuring confidence-based answer selection.

### **Steps to Integrate SmartAnswer with RAG**
1. **Retrieve relevant documents based on the query.**
2. **Generate an initial response using SmartAnswer.**
3. **Refine the response iteratively with TextGrad.**
4. **Use confidence-based Test-Time Scaling to decide whether to answer or abstain.**

### **Example Implementation**

```python
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

class RAGSmartAnswer:
    def __init__(self, retriever, model_name="gpt-4o"):
        self.retriever = retriever
        self.smart_answer = SmartAnswer(model_name)
    
    def get_answer(self, query):
        retrieved_docs = self.retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)
        context = "\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in retrieved_docs])
        combined_query = f"Context: {context}\nQuestion: {query}"
        return self.smart_answer.generate_answer(combined_query)
```

### **Testing RAG with SmartAnswer**

```python
# Initialize a vector database retriever
retriever = FAISS.load_local("./vectorstore", OpenAIEmbeddings())
rag_smart_answer = RAGSmartAnswer(retriever)

query = "What are the benefits of Test-Time Scaling?"
response = rag_smart_answer.get_answer(query)
print(f"RAG-SmartAnswer Response: {response}")
```

### **Benefits of SmartAnswer in RAG**
- **Ensures retrieved context is properly leveraged** before generating an answer.
- **Improves response accuracy through iterative refinement.**
- **Minimizes hallucinations by abstaining if the confidence is low.**
- **Optimally scales compute** based on confidence scores.

## **Conclusion**

By **implementing SmartAnswer**, we create an AI system that:
- **Refines responses iteratively** using TextGrad.
- **Applies confidence-based test-time scaling** to improve reasoning.
- **Avoids incorrect answers by abstaining when confidence is low**.
- **Integrates seamlessly into RAG pipelines** to improve answer relevance and accuracy.

This approach ensures that AI-generated answers are **more accurate, context-aware, and reliable**, making it ideal for **knowledge-intensive and high-stakes applications**.
