### Summary

[smolagents](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/en/index) is the framework that I want to use to build agents in this blog.

**What are agents:** functions that use LLM's or can be used by LLM's to accomplish a task.

**When to use agents:** whenever you are interacting with an LLM it should be through an agent. Whenever an LLM is interacting with your application or process it should be through and agent. 

**Why use smolagents:** its **new** small simple with a lot of support of the best of class LLM tools.
