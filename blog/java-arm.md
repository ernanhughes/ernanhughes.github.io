Tiny Core is a real small stripped down version of Linux.

I put it into an ova to save you the trouble of going through a setup and install.

You can download it here.

So why tinycore?

Size with all the power of linux. This is less than 20MB for a full distro.

Say if we think of Linux as a base application. 

We can then build and distribute pluggable components that in theory will run anywhere.

We get everything we have in Linux (scripting, scheduling, remote communication, security, stability) in 
a service.
